            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Thoughts of a Girl Geek Superstar</h1><p>Valentine's Day has roots in the ancient Roman festival of Â Lupercalia, a fertility celebration that occurred annually from February 13th to February 15th that was celebrated as far back as 44 BC (some historians say it goes back even further) where shepherds thought the celebration brought health and fertility to their sheep and cows. These ceremonies were apparently filled with animal sacrifices and a whole lot of nudity. Priests would lead the sacrifices of goats and young dogs due to the belief that these species had strong sexual instincts. Hmm, dogs and goats equal sexuality? Not surprisingly, the sacrifices were followed by copious amounts of wine. Once the libations kicked in full throttle the men would strip down dressing themselves in the animal skins of the recently sacrificed animals and would run around town striking women they wanted to pair up with with animal flesh. If the pairing was amenable to both parties the priest would marry the couple. I must say that I am glad that times have changed.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8c321150992567ce6cf31d5016a9b9903f18aee4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
